## Why Did I Choose Environmental Studies?

-   I care about the environment and want to learn more about it.
-   I enjoy ecology.
-   I wanted to learn about interconnected systems in the environment.

## Professional Intrests:

I really enjoy using GIS and R and am interested in doing those types of things as a profession.  I don't entirely know what I'm going to end up doing yet.
