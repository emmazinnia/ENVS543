## Growing up:

Growing up, my family was always spending time in the outdoors.  We loved camping, hiking, and simply exploring!  This gave me an appreciation for nature which I still have to this day.  They taught me to appreciate the world around me and that made me want to protect the environment for generations to come.

## I love the outdoors!

## Why Did I Choose Environmental Studies?

-   I care about the environment and want to learn more about it.
-   I enjoy ecology.
-   I wanted to learn about interconnected systems in the environment.

## Professional Interests:

I really enjoy using GIS and R and am interested in doing those types of things as a profession. I don't entirely know what I'm going to end up doing yet.
